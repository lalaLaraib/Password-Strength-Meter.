# Password-Strength-Meter.
This is my Password Strength Meter by Python..



The Password Strength Meter project is a tool that evaluates the strength of a user's password based on key security criteria. It checks:

Length (at least 9 characters),

Uppercase & Lowercase Letters,

At least one digit (0-9),

At least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).

The app gives a score (Weak, Moderate, or Strong) and provides feedback to improve weak passwords. It uses Streamlit for the interface and Python's re module for pattern matching to assess the password's strength. The app also suggests improvements for weak passwords to help users create stronger ones.
